### üèÜ Score: **125/100** (+25 for bonus)

## üë• Group Project

This project was completed in collaboration with [oliferovych](https://github.com/oliferovych)

## üìö Project Description

**Cub3d** is a project aimed at developing a 3D game inspired by early first-person shooters like **Wolfenstein 3D**. The objective is to simulate a 3D environment using raycasting, enabling the creation of realistic perspectives, texture mapping, and interactive elements. The project challenges you to understand core game development concepts such as real-time rendering, map parsing, and resource management

## üìö What I Learned

- **Raycasting**: Implemented raycasting to create a 3D world, simulating depth and perspective, including texture mapping and sprite rendering
- **Custom Map Parsing**: Developed a parser to read and validate custom .cub files, ensuring proper map layout, textures, etc.
- **Enhanced MLX42 Skills**: Gained proficiency with the MLX42 library for graphics rendering, event handling, and dynamic content display in a real-time game environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Game Implementation

The game is set in a chilling horror environment, where the player must navigate through dark corridors to find the exit while avoiding deadly monsters. The flashlight is crucial for revealing safe paths in the darkness. In cheat mode, players can shoot monsters that block the way, and a minimap provides additional guidance to help navigate the maze

### Key Features

- **Custom Maps**: Ability to create and play custom maps
- **Camera Mouse Controls**: Smooth first-person camera movement
- **Darkness and Light Effects**: Dynamic lighting to enhance atmosphere and navigation
- **Different Wall Textures**: Unique textures for each side of the walls, adding to the visual depth
- **Items**: Includes flashlight and gun for player interaction
- **Cheat Mode**: Unlock features like the gun and minimap
- **Dynamic HUD**: The minimap displays hints of the map
- **Functional Doors**: Interactive doors within the environment
- **Animated Enemies**: Monsters with hitboxes
- **Exit and Death Screens**: Displays upon reaching the exit or dying in the game
